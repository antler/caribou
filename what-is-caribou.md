# What is Caribou?

Caribou is a dynamic web application ecosystem for crafting production ready web
inhabitants with minimal effort.

Forged in the fire of daily requirements, Caribou is a collection of solutions
to problems web developers face every day.

The philosophy behind its development is to solve every problem we come across
once, in a general way that can be reused over and over.

Anything unnecessary or obstructive has been burned away from the wear of
constant use.

The result is Caribou, the kernel of usefulness that has emerged from years of
this basic practice.
