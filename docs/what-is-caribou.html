<h1>What is Caribou?</h1><p>Caribou is a dynamic web application ecosystem for crafting production ready web inhabitants with minimal effort.</p><p>Forged in the fire of daily requirements, Caribou is a collection of solutions to problems web developers face every day.</p><p>The philosophy behind its development is to solve every problem we come across once, in a general way that can be reused over and over.</p><p>Anything unnecessary or obstructive has been burned away from the wear of constant use.</p><p>The result is Caribou, the kernel of usefulness that has emerged from years of this basic practice.</p>
