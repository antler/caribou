        Caribou is a dynamic web application generator with antlers
      </div>
      
      <p>
        Caribou was designed to remove the extraneous effort usually required to 
        develop a web application.  Born from the daily toil of building real sites,
        this project collects a variety of useful functionality and forges it under
        a small set of powerful concepts into a coherent, cooperative system.  
      </p>

      <p>
        One overriding design philosophy has been the creation of small modules that 
        do one thing extremely well, and stay out of everyone else's way.  This entire
        process has been informed by witnessing the suffering inflicted by countless
        other frameworks on ourselves and our own friends and family.  
        The result is that there are a number of modules you may choose to wield 
        or not, as your needs dictate.
      </p>

      <h2>Core</h2>

      <p> 
        <a href="http://github.com/caribou/caribou-core">Caribou Core</a> lays the 
        foundation for all of the other libraries by capturing the data model of a site
        <em>as data!</em>  A data model is traditionally only an implicitly defined
        being, existing as a conglomeration of migrations and tables whose relationships
        are only formed through happy accidents within application code.  
        <a href="http://github.com/caribou/caribou-core">Caribou Core</a> structures
        the data model in a way that allows it to serve a variety of other purposes,
        including the construction of queries that filter and order based on the 
        relationships between models.
      </p>

      <h2>API</h2>

      <p> 
        <a href="http://github.com/caribou/caribou-api">Caribou API</a> provides a
        free, working, out of the box api for every model you create.  You can retrieve
        data across HTTP in a variety of formats (JSON, XML, CSV) and with an endless
        degree of refinement and expressiveness, all without laying a finger!  Enjoy
        some tea instead, get some sunshine.  
      </p>

      <h2>Frontend</h2>

      <p> 
        <a href="http://github.com/caribou/caribou-frontend">Caribou Frontend</a> 
        is the basis for a fully functional web application, with everything done
        except for <em>what the site actually is</em>, the whole point of you 
        undertaking this endeavor.  It provides routing based on a tree of pages 
        you define, once again benefiting from turning what was previously a 
        hard-coded consequence of application design into an infinitely malleable 
        medium at your control.  A Page forms a mapping between
        a route and an action, defined by you, which is simply whatever 
        you want it to do.  Here is where the *code* goes, if you require any.  
        In case that turns out to be rendering responses, 
        <a href="http://github.com/caribou/caribou-frontend">Caribou Frontend</a> 
        provides templates in the form of 
        <a href="http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html">Mustache</a>, 
        which are a graceful way of getting the point across.
      </p>

      <h2>Admin</h2>

      <p>
        Last but not least, 
        <a href="http://github.com/caribou/caribou-admin">Caribou Admin</a> 
        allows you to govern everything from behind a swift and capable web 
        interface.  Build models, link them, add pages, create content, link that,
        do anything (currently allowable).  No tacked on admin thrown together at 
        the last minute.  Let us handle that.
      </p>

      <h2>Supporting Libraries</h2>
      
      <p>
        There are a number of supporting libraries in the Caribou family, 
        (part of the <a href="http://github.com/caribou">Tundra</a>, if you will), 
        which contribute to Caribou but which also stand on their own as useful, 
        usable projects in their own right.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a current list of associated projects:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/caribou/lichen">Lichen</a>, 
        image manipulation on the tundra.</li>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/caribou/antlers">Antlers</a>, 
        templating with speed and profundity.</li>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/caribou/zippix">Zippix</a>, 
        harnessing zip files from resources, so that no one ever has to do that again.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dependencies</h2>

      <p>
        Caribou is written in <a href="http://clojure.org/rationale">Clojure</a>, 
        a fast, flexible language designed from the bottom up to be highly concurrent.
        If you are used to single-threaded interpreting languages like Ruby or Python,
        the performance increase can arrive as quite a shock.  Clojure finds the 
        sweet spot of deep expressiveness and raw animal speed, while gracefully 
        hurdling the problem of concurrency that have brought down so many before it.
        In other words, the Language of the Future.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have never heard of it, then this is the perfect opportunity to 
        <a href="http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html">learn</a>!
      </p>

      <p> 
        Caribou also uses 
        <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> as a build tool
        and command line utility, with its own leiningen plugin, 
        <a href="http://github.com/caribou/lein-caribou">Lein Caribou</a>. 
      </p>

      <p> 
        That's it!  Unless you would also like to harness the most powerful open
        source database available today: 
        <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgresql</a>, which Caribou supports 
        but does not require (though highly recommends!)
      </p>
      
      <h2>Install</h2>

      <p>
        Install Java >= 1.6</br></br>
        Install <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen 2</a></br></br>
        Create a new Caribou project:</br>
        <pre>$ lein new caribou pictograph</pre>

        Bootstrap and start the new project:</br>
        <pre>$ lein caribou migrate resources/config/development.clj</pre>
        <pre>$ cd pictograph</br>$ lein ring server
        </pre>
        
        Now navigate to your <a href="http://localhost:33333">new site</a>, and embark!
        (Later, play around with the <a href="http://localhost:33443">api</a> or the 
        <a href="http://localhost:33333/_admin/login">admin</a>).
      </p>
